# 🎨 Mood Tracker Feature

## Overview
A minimalist calendar-based mood tracking system that allows users to record their daily emotional state by coloring the entire day cell.

## Features

### 📅 Calendar Interface
- **Monthly view** with proper calendar layout
- **Greyed out dates** from previous/next months (non-interactive)
- **Today highlighting** with special border and glow
- **Month navigation** with previous/next buttons

### 🎨 Minimalist Mood System
- **5-color mood scale** with full-cell coloring:
  - 🔴 Red: Rough day (😞)
  - 🟠 Orange: Meh day (😐) 
  - 🟡 Yellow: Okay day (🙂)
  - 🟢 Green: Good day (😊)
  - 🔵 Blue: Great day (😄)

### 🔒 Current Day Only
- **Only today's mood can be set** - promotes mindful daily check-ins
- **Past days display** previous moods but are non-interactive
- **Future days remain** neutral until they become "today"

### 💾 Data Persistence
- **Automatic saving** to Chrome extension storage
- **Date-indexed storage** (`YYYY-MM-DD` format)
- **Persistent across sessions**

## User Interaction

### Setting Today's Mood
1. **Click mood color** in legend to select
2. **Click today's date** to apply selected mood (only today is clickable)
3. **Alternative**: Click today without selection to cycle through moods
4. **Full-cell coloring** provides immediate visual feedback

### Visual Design
- **Minimalist approach**: Entire day cell fills with mood color
- **Clean typography**: Bold white numbers on colored backgrounds
- **Today emphasis**: Special border and glow effect
- **Intentional limitation**: Only current day is interactive
